It did not also advertise the other VLANs that we actually use over SpeedFusion.  Would rather not have to manually enter the local VLAN subnets on each device to Custom Routes.\n\nI also tried using the Network Advertising drop-downs to select all of our VLANs - excluding the default LAN.  This did not work - remained stuck at \"Updating Routes\".\n\nThank you!",

Normal practice for them to connect/disconnect their laptop from the LAN as they take their laptop with them.\n\nIt's good to know though that this isn't impacting functionality then... Just a disconcerting feeling to see the stuck state in monitoring the tunnels.\n\nLook forward to the firmware update.\n\nThank you!",
